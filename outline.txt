Slide 1:

Prog. switching today
Pipeline: match + action, local memories

Slide 2:

A few problems with this.
Match + action coupled.
Couples memory consumption with compute.

Slide 3:

dRMT: a disaggregated version of RMT.
Retain RMT's instruction set, but disaggregate.

Slide 4: Memory disagg

Slide 5: Compute disagg

Slide 6: What benefits does this bring us?

Use motivating example from Section 2 on compute disagg

Slide 7: Benefit for memory disagg

Slide 8: Compiling to dRMT

Given P4 DAG, when you do schedule operations in dRMT?

Slide 9: Cyclic scheduling problem, ILP formulation

Slide 10: Future work: Stateful operations, 400G NIC implementation.
